# Darkweaver

Darkweaver is an ATOM style.less tweak based on the Dracula ATOM theme by Zeno Rocha to achieve the classic Dreamweaver colours on a dark background.

To get it, simply:

  - Install the Dracula theme by Zeno Rocha: https://draculatheme.com/atom/
  - Edit your local style.less file and paste the styles on this repo
